# PasswordFetcher
Program that makes use of LaZagne.exe to recover passwords. The program runs and sends a report with all the captured passwords in the victim's machine once a month.

## TODO
* Same as CaseLogger, FTP credentials are sent in plain text.
* Needs some sort of restoring the exe AKA make it persistent. Right now only the shortcat in startup is persistent. 
* Find a better way to launch program on startup
